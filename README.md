# FinGPT

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) to enable users to request financial stock market data by simply typing a natural language query. The project utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model to parse the user's input and transform it into a formatted dictionary, which is then used to retrieve stock data using the pandas-datareader and yfinance libraries. Finally, the stock data is plotted using matplotlib and displayed to the user using Gradio's web interface. Overall, this project simplifies the process of retrieving and visualizing stock data, making it accessible to a wider range of users.
